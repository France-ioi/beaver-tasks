          <h1>Gattaca</h1>
          <p>
              Each of the 30 face down cards below contains an "a", "c", "g" or "t". They represent part of a Beaver's DNA.
          </p>
          <p>
Somewhere in the DNA of the beaver the sequence <b>gattaca</b> is hidden. You have to try to find it by clicking on the cards to reveal which letter is on the other side. 
<p>
While you click the computer will try to work against you so you can't get too lucky. <p>
Try it! Click on the cards to flip them over. Try
to find the sequence in as few clicks as possible.<p>
<p>
You can try to improve your score as many times as you want.

          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>
            There are several approaches to solve this problem, but the main idea is generally to find ways to discard subsequences of cards and finding that they can't contain the word "gattaca", while uncovering only some of the letters in these subsequences.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if we click on the letter 7 and find a letter "c", then you can already conclude that the first letter can't be part of the word "gattaca". If you then click on the letter 8 and find a letter "t", then you can conclude that none of the letters until that "t" can be part of the solution, as the sequence "ct" does not  appear in "gattaca". You can then continue with this strategy, and click on the 15h letter.
          </p>
		  <p>
		    Since getting the correct answer to some degree depends on luck, you can get full points if you have used 12 steps whereas the optimal answer would only need 10 steps.
		  </p>
          <p>
             This strategy can be synthetised as the following : "At each step, click on the last card that may invalidate the first card that is not yet invalidated".
          </p>
          <h2>C'est de l'informatique !</h2>
          <p>
            This tasks consists in finding and applying an efficient algorithm to search for an occurrence of a word in a set of strings.
          </p>
          <p>
            The algorithm described in the solution resembles a well known string search algorithm: <b>Boyer-Moore</b>.

			<h2>Comments</h2>
			<ul>
			 <li>Sergei Pozdniakov: There is possibility to get solution with 13 steps using Boyer-Moor algorithm. Therefore it will be good to change phrase "you can get full points if you have used 12 steps" to "you can get full points if you have used 13 steps?"?
            </li>
            <li>Mathias Hiron: Saying "the computer will try to work against you" is misleading. If the computer really was working against the user, then it would be necessary to flip every single card. The computer is only preventing you from being too lucky, by deciding the location of the word only when there is only one possibility left. Maybe we could just say: "The computer will make sure you're not too lucky and find it right away"?
            </li>
				<li>Mathias Hiron: A version with 2 rows makes it much less likely to get a perfect score just by being lucky and not having any real strategy. I would suggest that countries who use this task consider this change, especially for the oldest students.</li>
				<li>Khairul Anwar M. Zaki, Peter Garscha and Christian Datzko: DOCUMENT YOUR CODE!</li>
				<li>(Spela Cerar) maybe just for the oldest group - to difficult otherwise [...]</li>
				<li><del>Khairul Anwar M. Zaki, Peter Garscha and Christian Datzko: the top points should also be reachable if you don't have the optimal solution, because that depends on randomness. => already done</del></li>
				<ul>
					<li><del>(Sergei Pozdniakov) How to compare solutions?</del></li>
					<li><del>(Eugenio Bravo) [...] when is this task correctly answered??</del></li>
				</ul>
				<li><del>Khairul Anwar M. Zaki, Peter Garscha and Christian Datzko: the two (or more) row model just makes it more time consuming, but not more difficult. Because the task is already too long, it should be only one row. This would also solve the &quot;dna-like&quot;-problem. => Done (Mathias wrote: "Please note that this is something I tried before, but then I changed my mind because it increased the chance of getting a good score by pure luck.")</del></li>
				<ul>
					<li><del>(Peter Garscha, Austria, peter@rlsux.com) maybe the dna-sequence can be arranged in one or two rows (dna-like [not three rows]) => I did 2 rows but not “dna-like” as it would change the nature of the problem.</del></li>
					<li><del>(Bronius Skupas) &gt;3 min</del></li>
					<li><del>(Christian Datzko) time killer</del></li>
					<li><del>(Maciej Syslo) hard, overall, are 2 rows necessary?</del></li>
					<li><del>(Spela Cerar) [...] time consuming if you don't guess the idea behind</del></li>
					<li><del>(Eugenio Bravo) It takes time to improve the score; [...]</del></li>
					<li><del>(Eljakim Schrijvers) is this done as a game so the answer depends on your clicks?</del></li>
				</ul>
				<li><del>Khairul Anwar M. Zaki, Peter Garscha and Christian Datzko: The answer should contain how many moves at most are necessary for maximum points.</del></li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><del>(Peter Garscha, Austria, peter@rlsux.com) the example contains multiple solutions in the second row. => fixed<del></li>
				<li><del>(Peter Garscha, Austria, peter@rlsux.com) (the title of the html-file refers to 2014-FR-01-ceremony). => fixed</del></li>
				<li><del>(Peter Garscha, Austria, peter@rlsux.com) If the goal is to flip as few cards as necessary it makes differences if someone starts at the left or the right end of the dna-sequence (also if 'gattaca' is contained just one time in the sequence) => fixed by library</del></li>
				<li><del>(Peter Garscha, Austria, peter@rlsux.com) or with a dynamic move-left/right slide (js: mouse move to left, moves the dna-sequence...); => I don't think this would be a good idea.</del></li>
